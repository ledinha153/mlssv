    <div class="intro-text">
      <p>
        In a life that keeps changing, I’ve learned that what matters most are the things that stay. 
        When everything feels uncertain—plans, emotions, direction—I hold onto the constants in my life. 
        They don’t make the noise disappear, but they give me something solid to stand on. They remind me 
        that no matter how confusing the world gets, I am not walking through it alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        God is my first constant. Even when my faith feels quiet, even when I struggle or question, His presence 
        remains steady. I don’t always have the right words or perfect prayers, but I know I’m held by something 
        bigger than myself. In moments of fear, weakness, or gratitude, I return to Him—not because life is easy, 
        but because His presence gives me peace that doesn’t depend on circumstances.
      </p>

      <p>
        My family is another constant—my foundation. They are the ones who know my roots, my history, and the parts 
        of me I don’t always explain. Their support doesn’t always come in grand gestures, but in consistency, care, 
        and being there when it matters. Through them, I learn what unconditional love looks like, even when life feels 
        heavy or messy.
      </p>

      <p>
        My friends are the quiet strength beside me. They see me as I am, not as who I’m supposed to be. With them, 
        I don’t need to perform or pretend. Their presence reminds me that connection doesn’t have to be loud to be real. 
        Sometimes it’s just shared silence, understanding looks, or laughter that makes difficult days feel lighter.
      </p>

      <p>
        And then there is my boyfriend—a constant that brings comfort, patience, and growth. He supports me not by 
        fixing everything, but by staying, listening, and choosing me in small, everyday ways. With him, I feel safe 
        enough to be vulnerable and strong at the same time. Together, we learn, grow, and face life as it comes, 
        knowing that love doesn’t mean perfection, but commitment.
      </p>

      <p>
        These are my constants—the faith that grounds me, the people who hold me, and the love that keeps me steady. 
        They are what I return to when the world feels overwhelming. They remind me who I am, where I belong, and why I keep going.
